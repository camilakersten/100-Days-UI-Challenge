This project is my interpretation of the 100 Days UI Challenge (https://www.dailyui.co/).

In this document I will log my discoveries and learnings with each challenge. I hope that in this way I can keep track of my progress and remember that learning a new skill is about persistence and time.

Thanks for visiting my repository! Let's connect!
