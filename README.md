This project is my interpretation of the 100 Days UI Challenge (https://www.dailyui.co/).

In this document I will log my discoveries and learnings with each challenge. I hope that in this way I can keep track of my progress and remember that learning a new skill is about persistence and time.

Thanks for visiting my repository! Let's connect!

#main
Worked around the Github Pages to successfully upload it with functional links and background.

#001
Discovered sites to find inspiration for my UI.

#002
Learned how to center an absolute element, YAY!
    position: absolute;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50px);
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
Found a good online color picker: **https://redketchup.io/color-picker**
Discovered autocomplete for forms.

#003
Today I learned that the smallest things can humble you, but you can win if you persevere.

#004 
Learned how to hide those little arrows in a numeric input.
I made my first project using JavaScript outside of a tutorial YAY!

#005 
Learned how I can position the background image to cover all the area but in a way that still covers the space when the screen is small.

#006
Used Bootstrap to create a page ðŸ™Œ

#007 
Learned that Google fonts also has icons, and I will be using the back arrow from now on.
Followed a tutorial to create a different layout for a settings page. Improved with funcional inputs.

#008
Found a good site with animations to incorporate in my projects.

#009
Today I was a little ambitious. The prompt was about designing a media player, and I wanted to incoporate some from npm. Mind you I never did it, and had a feeble grasp about Node.js and npm. At the start i wanted to incoporate one that was based in React, but after some good hours I chose another one and I succeeded! It may have put me behind schedule, but I'm grateful to have chosen the path that would bring me the most knowledge.

#010
Today, I learned how to clone a Git repository. I followed a tutorial that covered pointer events and the ~ selector. I particularly enjoyed the creative use of pseudo-selectors. Although my intention was to make all links functional, I only managed to implement it for Facebook. It's way past my bedtime, and I've only completed 10% of the challenge, so I need to conserve energy.

#011
Today I'm feeling a little underwhelmed because I wanted to make a better age validator, but had to stick with what I already know. I'm spending hours everyday tackling these challenges and I'm seriously considering putting a time limit from now on. Besides that, I hope you enjoy my Dating site for vampires.

#012
Today I had no inspiration for design, so I'm coding a design submitted by [Alexandra Paun in Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/4335565/attachments/4335565-E-commerce-item-Daily-012?mode=media).

#013
Today I tested the GitHub Copilot and I was impressed on how it knew the correct border radius to the baloon messages. In other moments it got in the way of work, but overall I have found it interesting.

#014
Today I followed a [simple tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWzjsMC810w) to achieve a countdown timer.

#015
Today I learned how to create a dark mode toggle.

#016
Today I learned how to use the dialog tag.

#017
Today I solved a challenge from Frontend Mentor, and it was my first time following a design from Figma. It was really interesting.

#019
Today I challenge myself to use AI to solve the challenge. Since it was my first time using I had a difficult time to make it create something appealing. Going forward I think I can use AI to generate gradients or solve me some problems, but not necessarily use it to make it from scratch.

#020
Today I used CSS Grid for the first time, and I will definitely will be using it more going forward.

#022 
Today I created a custom google search box using only the documentation available.
